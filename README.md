## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This Power BI project analyzes sales performance and customer behavior using a structured dataset. The dashboards provide key insights into revenue, product performance, and customer trends to help businesses make data-driven decisions.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective
The primary objectives of this project are:
- To analyze **sales performance** across different products, states, and time periods.
- To segment **customers** based on age groups, purchasing patterns, and geography.
- To track **revenue trends**, monthly differences, and MoM growth.
- To improve **business decision-making** by providing clear, interactive insights.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset Description
The project uses three main datasets:
- **Customer Data (`customer_dim.csv`)** â€“ Contains customer demographics, segments, and purchase history.
- **Product Data (`product_dim.csv`)** â€“ Includes product details, with duplicate and invalid price data removed.
- **Sales Transactions (`sales_transactions.csv`)** â€“ Sales records with a newly added `revenue` column for analysis.

## ðŸ›  Data Cleaning & Transformations
- **Customer Table:** Added `city`, `state`, `age group`, `customer segment`, and `customer quantity segment`.
- **Product Table:** Removed duplicate products and invalid price entries.
- **Sales Transactions Table:** Added `revenue` column.
- **Date Table:** Created a separate date table for time-based analysis.
- **Dashboard Enhancements:** Included total sales, total quantity sold, and total orders, along with their monthly differences and Month-over-Month (MoM) growth.

## ðŸ“Š Key Insights
- **Total Revenue:** $32.06M
- **Top 5 Products by Revenue:** MacBook Pro, iPhone, ThinkPad Laptop, Google Phone, 34-inch Ultrawide Monitor
